Thus far I'm approximately 40% of the way through Odin FOUNDATIONS. This project will provide me an opportunity to practice all of the HTML knowledge I've acquired up to this point. The project is building a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. It will be a basic website (not very pretty), however it will improve my HTML skills, and I will revisit later to style it up with CSS (once I learn that).
